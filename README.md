## Project 3 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree (Part 2 of 2)

This app allows users to keep a list of books in a local database. Data is pulled from the Google Books Api, documentation [here] (https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)

In this project, I diagnosed problems in the existing app based on user feedback and added enhancements in order to make it production ready. The work included implementing barcode scanning functionality in-app and ensuring errors were handled gracefully.
